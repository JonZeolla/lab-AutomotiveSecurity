# Reading recordings from the CAN bus  
## Virtual labs  
### `canbus_listen.py`  
Play around with `${HOME}/Desktop/lab-AutomotiveSecurity/external/Python_Can/canbus_listen.py`  

### Generic CAN recording  
Investigate `CANRecording.txt` from `${HOME}/Desktop/lab-AutomotiveSecurity/store/CANRecording.txt`  

## Hardware labs
